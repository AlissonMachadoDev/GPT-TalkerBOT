    "The category is 'Outstanding Debut'
Charlotte Wells, we love Aftersun
Georgia Helen, Blue Jean's the one
Elena, Maia, the teamwork's grand
Good luck to you, Katy Brand
Electric Malady, Marie, girl, what a slay
Sandy Powell with the Fellowship
Costume queen, can you fix this zip?
Other ladies in the room
Supporting and leading, all here I presume
Hong Chau, Dolly D, Kerry and Cary with a 'C'
Dame Emma, I'm so fond
Ana, girl, you were great in Blonde
Danielle D, you broke my heart
Michelle, I loved you from the start
Angela Bassett did the thing
Viola Davis, my woman king
Blanchett, Cate, you're a genius
And Jamie Lee, you are all of us!
Not one of us gets here alone
With all these queens, we need a bigger throne
House of BAFTA, the vibe is strong
Be true to you, you can't go wrong"
